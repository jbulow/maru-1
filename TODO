make eval.c eval.l use WIDE CHARACTERS

propagate changes eval.c -> eval.l

inheritance between structures

active variables
	implement inst var access by name

split emit.l into
	emit-common.l	the stuff that does not depend on the target language
	emit-386.l	static x86 code
	emit-c.l	static C code

make local variables store level delta not absolute level
	-> new <variable> object for each delta of free reference

optimise eval.c for
	size check on invocation
	cached allocation behavior - dlist

----------------------------------------------------------------

make encode rewrite r-value variables as the value when value is subr

----------------------------------------------------------------

split <ptr> type from <long>.

port streams.

port PEG.

The crux of the biscuit is: If it entertains you, fine.  Enjoy it.  If
it doesn't, then blow it out your ass.  I do it to amuse myself.  If I
like it, I release it.  If somebody else likes it, that's a bonus.
-- Frank Zappa
